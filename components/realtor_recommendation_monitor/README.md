# Component Name

RealtorRecommendationMonitor

# Description

RealtorRecommendationMonitor is a Yeager Workflow component designed to monitor realtor recommendations in targeted Facebook groups, extract user information, and send a message. It returns the sent message status and extracted user data.

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model

RealtorRecommendationMonitorIn - This class takes the following fields as input:

1. facebook_api_credentials (dict): The API credentials for interacting with the Facebook API.
2. targeted_group_ids (List[str]): List of targeted Facebook group IDs to monitor.
3. messaging_platform_credentials (dict): The API credentials for interacting with the messaging platform.
4. melissa_api_credentials (dict): The API credentials for interacting with the Melissa API.

## Output Model

RealtorRecommendationMonitorOut - This class returns the following fields as output:

1. sent_message_status (str): The status of the sent message to the user.
2. extracted_user_name_and_phone (dict): Extracted user information containing user name and phone number.

# Parameters

The following parameters are used in the RealtorRecommendationMonitor class:

1. args: RealtorRecommendationMonitorIn - The input model containing configuration and credentials for monitoring and sending messages.
2. callbacks: typing.Any - A placeholder for callback functions (not used in this implementation).

# Transform Function

The transform() method of the RealtorRecommendationMonitor class is implemented as follows:

1. Call the transform() method of the superclass (AbstractWorkflow) and pass the arguments and callbacks.
2. Extract sent_message_status and extracted_user_info from the result dictionary.
3. Create a RealtorRecommendationMonitorOut object and pass the extracted data.
4. Return the RealtorRecommendationMonitorOut object.

# External Dependencies

The following external libraries are used in RealorRecommendationMonitor:

1. typing: Provides type hints for better code readability and type checking.
2. dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
3. fastapi: Creates an API for the RealtorRecommendationMonitor component.
4. pydantic: Provides BaseModel for input and output data validation and serialization.

# API Calls

Currently, there are no external API calls made by the component. However, the input models expect API credentials for Facebook, messaging platform, and Melissa API. This implies that the component is designed to integrate with these services in future implementations.

# Error Handling

The component does not have specific error handling mechanisms implemented. It relies on FastAPI and Pydantic to handle input validation and error handling.

# Examples

To use the RealtorRecommendationMonitor component within a Yeager Workflow:

1. Import necessary packages.
2. Create an instance of the RealtorRecommendationMonitor class.
3. Create a RealtorRecommendationMonitorIn object passing required parameters.
4. Call the transform() method, passing the RealtorRecommendationMonitorIn object, and obtain the output.
